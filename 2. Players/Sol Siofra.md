## Backstory

Sol spent the first few years of her life traveling through the wilds with her mother, Amma. As a very young child, she was abandoned in the Smokey Wood by her mother. An isolated druidic circle in the woods stumbled across her, and though wary of outsiders, took in the lonesome child. She tried to adapt to their way of life and magic, but her unwieldy fire magic wasn’t the only cause of friction between the tribe and their wayward charge.  To keep strangers away and protect their secrets, the tribe used Sol, an outsider herself, as a means to barter and trade with a local guide, Stirges Galavant. In return, he steered others away from the tribe’s lands.   As she came of age, and after one accident too many, Tribe Òr-adharcach sent Sol on her way. Now, she heads off into the world to learn to harness her magic and to discover the secrets of her past and lineage.
