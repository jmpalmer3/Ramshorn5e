## Backstory
 
For most of his life, Cindril has been a fighter, dueling it out with his friends when they were kids, and although he wasn't the most built he knew how to make the punches count, thanks to his father mentoring him. Eventually going into the boxing tournament that the town would hold once a year.   From a young age Cindril has always had a feeling of wanderlust, coupled with a profound curiosity for the unknown. Mostly involving the Fey and the tales the townsfolk would tell warning of their trickery to try and take people away, never to be seen again. Despite all this, Cindril would often go off into the forest to explore and try and catch a glimpse of one of the faefolk. Or at the very least see if he could find anything interesting.  It was always said that the Fey were more prominent whenever there were festivities, never ones to miss out on a party. And one year, during the Midsummer festival, when Cindril was 15, he ventured out into the forest around dusk. This time very much against his parents wishes, more so than most of the year, but Cindril knew he had a better chance of finding something now than any other time of the year.  So as always he wandered around the forest, being cautious as to not scare anything away or provoke anything. The last thing he remembers is finding a faerie circle. Then next thing he knows he's resting on the edge of the forest with a pair of red teashades in hand. It was morning when he woke up so he headed home. When he arrived his parents looked like they'd seen a ghost. Turns out he had been gone for a year, and with it his hair had turned a silvery white and his eyes a whitish gray as well. After that day, Cindril could never find the faerie circle again no matter how hard he tried to retrace his steps that day.
