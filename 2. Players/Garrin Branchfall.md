## Character Goal

Garrin wants to save and help as many people as possible to atone for the crimes committed by him and his family, especially the death of his best friend, Mirelle. He has vowed to never again wield the broken sword his family is known for. Short Term Goal: For the first time in a year, Garrin’s parents have once again sent a small group to find him and return him to the Blades. This newest party is led by Barathon Staffield, Mirelle’s father. Garrin is not sure if they know he was responsible for Mirelle’s death, but he doesn’t want to find out.

## Backstory

Garrin Branchfall is the son of Daeric and Enthyra Branchfall, leaders of an outlaw band known as the Broken Blades, due to the broken sword that Daeric used when they began their criminal activities. They were not originally outlaws, and in fact started out as many others did on Minastria, simply a handful of adventurers looking to cash in on the money and power the shards offered. However, they quickly found that competition was stiff for even the smallest shards, and when they did get their hands on some, the real money was to be found selling on the black market. Their lust for power greater than their morals, Daeric and Enthyra changed tactics. They gathered together a larger crew, and started by robbing members of lower-level guilds as they would return from expeditions. By the time Garrin was born, the enterprise was thriving, and the Broken Blades stayed on the move between several well-hidden and fortified hideouts on the outskirts of major cities in shard-rich regions. 

For the most part, Garrin enjoyed life in the Broken Blades. As the son of the leaders, he grew up educated by the finest kidnapped tutors. Tall and wiry, his practical education was mostly gained as a scout for the group, along with his best friend in the world, a girl named Mirelle. Mirelle was the daughter of his parents’ right hand man, Barathon Staffield. The pair were inseparable since birth, and they were being groomed to take over the Blades from Daeric and Enthyra when the time came.

Garrin and Mirelle were often sent out on scouting missions together, doing anything from recon on potential scores to gathering intel on rival gangs or efforts to locate the Blades. On one such mission, the unthinkable happened, and Mirelle was killed. Garrin panicked and fled, unable to handle his culpability in the death of the girl he loved. After a long stretch of barely surviving in the wilderness, he came across a shrine to Kratris, and laying his own broken blade at her altar, swore himself to her service. Now, he wanders the land as a healer, doing what he can to pay for his crimes, and those of his family, who he continues to evade as they search for him.
