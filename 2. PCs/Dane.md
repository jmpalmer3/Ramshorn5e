## Backstory

Born Dane Ogden to father [[Lars Ogden]] and mother [[Astrid Thrane-Ogden]], Dane had an incredibly average upbringing. His father taught him strength and discipline while his mother taught him faith and how to fight. As Dane got older, he was schooled in the arts of woodcarving and winemaking from his parents. While Dane loved working with his hands, his true passion lied in stories of heroes. Not long after, he would discover his parents were both accomplished adventurers in their own rights, with plenty of stories shared by [[Jean-Georges Gérin-Lajoie]].   This stoked the flames of adventure that burned in his little heart, prompting him to gather up the other youth in his area and form a large adventuring party he named [[The Shepherds]]. They would complete various quests around town, such as gathering herbs and hunting in the Smokey Wood, fetching ores and minerals from the Eastern Cleaver's Cliff or the river that feeds Pipe Lake, and finding lost pets and items for the locals. Eventually, as the members of the Shepherds grew older, so too did they grow apart-- going their seperate ways to pursue their own paths in life. All except for Dane, who had no reason to leave his loving home and couldn't bring himself to abandon the obligations of his post as the Sheepdog of [[Ramshorn]].  As Dane grew older, becoming a man in his own right, he was gifted his father's adventuring gear and his mother's pendant-- and with their blessing began taking on far more serious tasks such as defending livestock from predators, waylaying bandits and highwaymen, and protecting locals and travellers from the neighboring monsters. Dane would inevitably be scouted by fledgling adventuring parties, itching to set out on their respective journeys, turning them all down without exception. To this day, Dane bides his time, doing his duty as Sheepdog, waiting for the perfect group of people for whom he would be willing to leave his post.
