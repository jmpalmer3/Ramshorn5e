## Backstory 

Zion grew up as your stereotypical small town boy. His family owned a respectable sized farm where they grew wheat that they would harvest and sell in the close by city of [[Ramshorn]]. Most of his life Zion was meek, never having particularly strong drive to do anything, but being around others filled his sense of emptiness. Instead, Zion would latch onto strong personalities and his voice would become theirs. As a young boy and into his teenage years Zion ran with a group of kids that took to calling themselves [[The Shepherds]]. It was with them where he first learned to fight and found that he had a way with words that was a little beyond just having a silver tongue. Anytime one of The Shepherds quest didn’t go exactly as planned and they found themselves in a little trouble, Zion was able to talk down their punishment.    

As Zion grew older he became particularly interested in the daughter of one of their long time customers. [[Victoria Dawnbreak]] was a baker’s daughter, she was strong, feisty, confrontational, and beautiful. Overtime Zion hung out with The Shepherds less and less and fell in love with Veronica more and more. It culminated in the pair running away together. Often the pair would find themselves getting into trouble, usually due to Veronica’s big personality, and Zion getting them out of it. This period of his life was a rush of uncertainty that led to the ultimate twist of Veronica and Zion having a baby. Sara, the pairs daughter named after Saranrae, was born ill. Zion and Veronica did all they could to care for her. However, the bills and tax collectors kept coming and there was only so much they could bring in before their money ran dry. Their neighbors provided charity as best as they could with babysitting, meals, and the occasional anonymous envelope. The church did all they could in terms of healing, even though they strongly hinted at owing donations. However, the tax collectors were ruthless and refused any leniency. Eventually Sara was united with the goddess she was named after. Lost and confused the pair were eventually approached by the Free Regatia movement. The recruiter directed their anger towards the ruling class and Veronica fell deep for the recruiter’s words and promises. Zion wasn’t sure but followed his wife anyway. Eventually Zion felt his wife slipping farther and farther into the movement, being brought into the folds of the more inner circle. While Zion himself felt left in the dust by both the movement and his wife, due to his doubts and questioning.

When Veronica left on a mission with no set end date, Zion finally decided that enough was enough. He returned home to live with his parents until he figures out his next steps. Surprisingly, he reunited with old friends and felt a sense of belonging and adventure that he had long forgotten. Now Zion doesn’t want to fall back into his old role of the get out of jail free card, but hopes to become someone they can all depend on. ```
