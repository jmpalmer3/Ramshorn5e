## Backstory

Born with bastard blood, Dramus is a son of the House of Ardor. House Ardor is one of the most respected noble families within the House of the Sun. Praised for their natural aptitude for pyromancy which is noted by their conjured flames being uniquely purple in color. They are often cited as some of the best duelists around, often standing toe-to-toe with the militaries House Knights and Spell-Blades alike. Because of their renown, Dramus was quickly sent away from House Ardor before he was even born, as failure to uphold the families pureblood legacy could be seen as a smear on Ardor's honor. Thus, Dramus was born in the mountain village of [[Ramshorn]], cared for solely by his mother [[Calindra Solberg]]. As a young boy, Dramus became fast friends with the other kids in the village, being one of the members of the Shepherds throughout his young childhood, never once feeling like he wasn't just like the rest of them.   All good things must come to an end though, as word of Dramus' existence spread through House Ardor, and a convoy was sent to Ramshorn to retrieve him. Calindra was hesitant at first, but decided it was best if he knew where he came from. Dramus world was turned upside down, the quaint mountain village where play was his priority quickly grew to feel like a distant memory as he was brought into House Ardor. He was trained, tutored, and when his sorcerous blood awakened, he was taught how to use it. He attended meetings of strategical and political nature, fancy dinners, and more, but he ultimately grew tired of the lifestyle. It was a stroke of luck then that his father gave him the opportunity to leave and explore more of the outside world on his own, a "coming of age pilgrimage" of sorts that all in Ardor go on at some point or another.  But he went back to Ramshorn, as he longed for the simpler life that he once knew. He missed his mother, his friends, and everything else the village had to offer. Where he goes from here remains to be seen...
