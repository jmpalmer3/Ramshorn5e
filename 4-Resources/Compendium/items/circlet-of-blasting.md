# Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/circlet-of-blasting.webp#right)  


While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the [scorching ray](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/scorching-ray.md) spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of `dice: d20+5` (+5). The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
