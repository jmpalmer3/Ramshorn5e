# Staff of Frost
*Staff, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/staff-of-frost.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [cone of cold](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md) (5 charges), [fog cloud](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) (1 charge), [ice storm](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/ice-storm.md) (4 charges), or [wall of ice](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/wall-of-ice.md) (4 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
