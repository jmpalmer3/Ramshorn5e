# Wand of Magic Missiles
*Wand, major, uncommon*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/wand-of-magic-missiles.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [magic missile](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
