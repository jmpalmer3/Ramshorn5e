# Heart Weaver's Primer
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: [antipathy/sympathy](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/antipathy-sympathy.md), [charm person](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [dominate person](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/dominate-person.md), [enthrall](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/enthrall.md), [hypnotic pattern](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md), [modify memory](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/modify-memory.md), and [suggestion](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/suggestion.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.  
- When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
