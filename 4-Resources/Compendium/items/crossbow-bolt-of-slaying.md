# Crossbow Bolt of Slaying
*Ammunition, minor, very rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.075 lbs.

baseName/at baseName/l of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *baseName/ls of dragon slaying* and *baseName/ls of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with baseName/a baseName/l of slaying takes damage from the baseName/l, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `dice: 6d10|avg` (`6d10`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once baseName/a baseName/l of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical baseName/l.
