# Cloak of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/cloak-of-elvenkind.webp#right)  


While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([Perception](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
