# Medallion of Thoughts
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/medallion-of-thoughts.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [detect thoughts](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
