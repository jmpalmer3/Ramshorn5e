# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an [earth elemental](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md), as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md) spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
