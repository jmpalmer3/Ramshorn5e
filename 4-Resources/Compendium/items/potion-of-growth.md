# Potion of Growth
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [enlarge/reduce](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell for `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours (no [concentration](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#concentration) required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
