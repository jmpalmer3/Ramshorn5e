# Staff of Swarming Insects
*Staff, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](4-Resources/Compendium/items/img/staff-of-swarming-insects.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, a [swarm of insects](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-insects.md) consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [giant insect](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/giant-insect.md) (4 charges) or [insect plague](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/insect-plague.md) (5 charges).

## Insect Cloud

While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.
