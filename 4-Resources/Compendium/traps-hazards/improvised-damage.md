# Improvised Damage
*Generic Hazard*  

In some cases you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

![Improvising Damage](4-Resources/Compendium/tables/improvising-damage.md)

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage numbers are for characters of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of the damage.

**Damage Severity and Level**

| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1st-4th | `dice: 1d10\|avg` (`1d10`) | `dice: 2d10\|avg` (`2d10`) | `dice: 4d10\|avg` (`4d10`) |
| 5th-10th | `dice: 2d10\|avg` (`2d10`) | `dice: 4d10\|avg` (`4d10`) | `dice: 10d10\|avg` (`10d10`) |
| 11th-16th | `dice: 4d10\|avg` (`4d10`) | `dice: 10d10\|avg` (`10d10`) | `dice: 18d10\|avg` (`18d10`) |
| 17th-20th | `dice: 10d10\|avg` (`10d10`) | `dice: 18d10\|avg` (`18d10`) | `dice: 24d10\|avg` (`24d10`) |

Damage sufficient to cause a **setback** rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage.

In contrast, **dangerous** damage values pose a significant threat to weaker characters and could potentially kill a character of the level shown if that character is missing many hit points.

As the name suggests, **deadly** damage is enough to drop a character of the level shown to 0 hit points. This level of damage can kill even powerful characters outright if they are already wounded.
