# Ray of Sickness
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also [poisoned](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Alchemist)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/artificer-alchemist-tce.md), [Cleric (Death Domain)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/cleric-death-domain.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/wizard.md)
