# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#deafened) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

**Classes**: [Bard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/bard.md), [Cleric](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/cleric.md), [Druid (Circle of the Land)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md), [Monk (Way of Shadow)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/monk-way-of-shadow.md), [Ranger](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/ranger.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Warlock (The Fathomless)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/warlock-the-fathomless-tce.md)
