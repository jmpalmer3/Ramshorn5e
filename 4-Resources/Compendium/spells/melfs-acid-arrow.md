# Melf's Acid Arrow
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 4d4|avg` (`4d4`) acid damage immediately and `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
