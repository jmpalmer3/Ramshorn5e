# Sunburst
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, fire and a piece of sunstone
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 12d6|avg` (`12d6`) radiant damage and is [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

**Classes**: [Druid](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/druid.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Sorcerer](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](4-Resources/Compendium/classes/wizard.md)
