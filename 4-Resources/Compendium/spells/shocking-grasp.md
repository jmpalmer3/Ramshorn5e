# Shocking Grasp
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg` (`3d8`)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg` (`4d8`)).
