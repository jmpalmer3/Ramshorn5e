# [Giant Spider](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 328, Lost Mine of Phandelver, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

To snare its prey, a giant spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.
