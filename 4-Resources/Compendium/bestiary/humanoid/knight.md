# [Knight](4-Resources/Compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.
