# Polearm Master
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  

You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. You gain the following benefits:

- When you take the [Attack](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action and attack with only a [glaive](4-Resources/Compendium/items/glaive.md), [halberd](4-Resources/Compendium/items/halberd.md), [quarterstaff](4-Resources/Compendium/items/quarterstaff.md), or [spear](4-Resources/Compendium/items/spear.md), you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon; this attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`), and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.  
- While you are wielding a [glaive](4-Resources/Compendium/items/glaive.md), [halberd](4-Resources/Compendium/items/halberd.md), [pike](4-Resources/Compendium/items/pike.md), [quarterstaff](4-Resources/Compendium/items/quarterstaff.md), or [spear](4-Resources/Compendium/items/spear.md), other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.
