# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42*  

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a [shield](4-Resources/Compendium/items/shield.md) when you make the attack roll, the `dice: d6|avg` (`d6`) becomes a `dice: d8|avg` (`d8`).

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) bludgeoning damage to one creature [grappled](4-Resources/Compendium/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by you.
