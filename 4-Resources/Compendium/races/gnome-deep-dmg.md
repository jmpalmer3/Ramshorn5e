- **At will.** [nondetection](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/nondetection.md) (self only)  
- **1/day each.** [blindness/deafness](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/blindness-deafness.md), [blur](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/blur.md), [disguise self](4-Resources/Compendium/spells/disguise-self.md)

You can speak, read, and write Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon.
