A regal travelling high-elven bard from Ebracouster and places both foreign and exotic. An incredibly charismatic wandering minstrel who sings the stories of the heroes of Regatia and lands beyond, in exchange for fine dining and accomodations-- which he assures you he finds quite frequently. Met Dane and his family along his journey in Ramshorn and took a special liking to Astrid's wine for both its taste and affordability. Would regale Dane of heroic tales, including those of his parents, and is in no small part responsible for Dane's call to adventure. Dane idolized him as a child, retelling the stories to his friends in The Shepherds and going so far as to partially imitate his manner of speech. Still travels throughout Regatia to this day, spreading the stories of heroes of old and planting the seeds of adventuring in the minds of impressionable youths-- taking special care to stop by Ramshorn every so often to catch up with the Ogdens and drown himself in Astrid's wine.
