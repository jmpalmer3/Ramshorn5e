Retired adventurer-turned-vintner and Dane's mother. Renowned as a sword-saint of Cayden Cailean, known for her resourcefulness in a fight and successful gambling career. Taught Dane the value of craftsmanship, luck, and being meticulous in one's work. With Lars' blessing, she raised Dane as a fellow Caydenite, placing an emphasis on the importance of opportunities and being quick to seize them-- both in life and in a fight. Isn't a fan of Magitech's ease-of-use compared to study of magic or strength of faith, but understands its usefulness in the modern world. Discovered through her faith a distinct love of "hearty" wine-- that is, satisfying wine able to be enjoyed by all-- as opposed to the finer wines unobtainable to most. Currently works as a vintner under "Thrane-Ogden's Honest Winery".
