Garrinâ€™s best friend from the time they were children. Everyone expected them to get together, and they were making tentative moves in that direction when tragedy struck and Mirelle was killed. Garrin feels fully responsible for her death, and it was the catalyst for him leaving the Broken Blades and dedicating his life to healing in service of the goddess Kratris.
