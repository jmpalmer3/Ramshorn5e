Garrinâ€™s father, co-leader of the Broken Blades with his wife, Enthyra. Well-scarred from his many combats, he is a shrewd and ruthless fighter, known for his use of a broken sword. He moves with the gang between various hideouts to avoid detection. He taught Garrin everything he knows about wilderness survival.While he is proud of his son, the two are not close emotionally, and Garrin is pretty sure that if it came down to it, Daeric would choose the Blades over him.
