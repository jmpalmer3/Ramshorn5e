The fishing extraordinaire of Ramshorn. Unmatched with a rod, Shaemus is a master angler and incredible teacher. He taught Dramus to fish, introducing him to his favorite hobby. Dramus always felt closer to him than any of the other adults in the village. He's always found inside his shack snoozing, or out on his personally built fishing pier enjoying his day doing what he does best while partaking in the worst pisswater liquor you can imagine. He is also the host of a big event held in Ramshorn, the semi-annual "Fishing Tourney" where the village's best fishers gather up and compete to make the biggest, most impressive catch they can.
