Cindril’s father. He's loud, bombastic, he likes to show Cindril off. When he was younger he used to fistfight for sport and was fairly good at it, taught Cindril everything he knew about fist fighting. He now works at a small local brewery, moving/loading barrels. He doesn't mind the stuff they make but he greatly prefers the dwarven stuff.  Anette Odd: Cindril’s mother. She works at a bakery and is a part time seamstress. Would tell stories about the fey and how to protect yourself from them to a young Cindril.
