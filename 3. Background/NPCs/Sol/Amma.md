Sol’s mother.  Sol doesn’t have many memories of her from her childhood – mostly she remembers traveling through the wilds with her. She abandoned Sol when she was very young, after which she was taken in by a druidic circle.  Tribe Òr-adharcach – the druidic circle that took in Sol as a child. They gave her the last name ‘Síofra’.
