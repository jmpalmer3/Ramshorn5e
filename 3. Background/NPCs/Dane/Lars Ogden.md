Retired adventurer-turned-logger and Dane's father. Originally served in the Regatian military for a short time before turning to a life of adventuring. Taught Dane the value of hard work and "doing what's right". Believes the world is a far simpler place than people seem to understand, and that Regatia's obsession with Magic and Magitech has made its people forget that true strength comes from community and your fellow man. Very old-fashioned, enjoys his drink after long days of hard labor. Made enough money adventuring in his youth with his now wife Astrid to live comfortably for the rest of his days, but still opts to earn an honest living providing lumber and furniture for the town of Ramshorn."
