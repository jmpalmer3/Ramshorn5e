His older brother, right-hand man to Darius and pure of blood unlike Dramus. Second in power only to his father, he shares many of the same qualities that he does, but does not harbor any softness for Dramus and in fact despises him. Because of his bastard blood, he believes Dramus to be unworthy of the family name and the power that comes with it. Filled with more vices than you can count (drinking, drugs, brawling, etc) but never facing the consequences of them, he is the definition of spoiled noble brat.
