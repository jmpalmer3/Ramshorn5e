His Drow father, who is almost the polar opposite of Calindra. A powerful sorcerer and head of House Ardor. He often sees many "Groundwalkers" as beneath him and his family, and measures stature by magical prowess. Upholding the prestige of the Ardor family is his number one priority, and because of his many accolades he is one of the most respected figures within the House of the Sun. Despite his blunt exterior, he does harbor a soft spot for his children, and only wishes to see them surpass him, however impossible of a feat that may seem on the outside.
