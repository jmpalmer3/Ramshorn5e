His kind, and loving Human mother who lives in Ramshorn. She is one of Ramshorns highly skilled weavers, often praised for her ability to make high quality, durable clothing for next to no cost and little material. She once served as a clothing designer for the House of the Sun, for the noble Ardor house specifically. Despite her status, she was romantically involved with the Head of the Ardor house, which lead to her pregnancy with Dramus. Knowing the consequences for both of them, Dramus' father sent her away with enough money to start a new life far away and take care of their son. She values Ramshorn highly, and loves her son more than anything else in the world. Because of this nurturing nature, many of the kids in the village are very fond of her.
