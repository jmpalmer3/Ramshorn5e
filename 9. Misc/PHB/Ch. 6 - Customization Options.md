# Chapter 6: Customization Options

The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who — with the DM’s permission — want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

#### Multiclassing Prerequisites
| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Barbarian | Strength 13                 |
| Bard      | Charisma 13                 |
| Cleric    | Wisdom 13                   |
| Druid     | Wisdom 13                   |
| Fighter   | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |
| Paladin   | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Ranger    | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |
| Rogue     | Dexterity 13                |
| Sorcerer  | Charisma 13                 |
| Warlock   | Charisma 13                 |
| Wizard    | Intelligence 13             |

### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the [[Character Advancement]] table in [[chapter 1]], not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, [[Character Advancement]] table in [[chapter 1]], not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the [[Multiclassing Proficiencies]] table.

MULTICLASSING EXAMPLE

Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a fighter. Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot of time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser. Gary decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).

When Gary’s character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/wizard 1).

#### Multiclassing Proficiencies
|Class|Proficiencies Gained|
|---|---|
|Barbarian|Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons|
|Bard|Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice|
|Cleric|Light armor, medium armor, shields|
|Druid|Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)|
|Fighter|Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons|
|Monk|Simple weapons, shortswords|
|Paladin|Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons|
|Ranger|Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list|
|Rogue|Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools|
|Sorcerer|-|
|Warlock|Light armor, simple weapons|
|Wizard|-|

## Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.

### Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

_**Spells Known and Prepared.**_ You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a [[holy symbol]], can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

_**Spell Slots.**_ You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the [[Multiclass Spellcaster]] table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like [[burning hands]], has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.

_**Pact Magic.**_ If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

## Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the [[Grappler]] feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow — perhaps by a withering curse — you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

Feats are listed below.

- You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check contested by your Charisma ([[Deception]]) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.

- You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.

### Charger

When you use your action to [[Dash]], you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to [[shove]] a creature.

If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to [[shove]] and you succeed).

### Crossbow Expert

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the [[loading]] property of crossbows with which you are proficient.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose [[disadvantage]] on your ranged attack rolls.

- You have [[advantage]] on [[saving throws]] made to avoid or resist traps.
- You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.
- Traveling at a fast pace doesn’t impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom ([[Perception]]) score.

### Durable

Hardy and resilient, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you roll a [[Hit Die]] to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).

### Elemental Adept

_Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell_

When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.

- On your turn, when you score a [[critical hit]] with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
- Before you make a melee attack with a [[heavy]] weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a –5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.

### Healer

You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:

- When you use a [[healer’s kit]] to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point.
- As an action, you can spend one use of a [[healer’s kit]] to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature’s maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can’t regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.

### Heavily Armored

- You learn three languages of your choice.
- You can ably create written ciphers. Others can’t decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC equal to your Intelligence score + your proficiency bonus), or they use magic to decipher it.

### Lucky

You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker’s roll or yours.

If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.

You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

### Mage Slayer

You have practiced techniques useful in melee combat against spellcasters, gaining the following benefits:

- When a creature within 5 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

- You have [[advantage]] on [[saving throws]] against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet of you.

### Magic Initiate

Choose a class: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class’s spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell to learn from that same list. Using this feat, you can cast the spell once at its lowest level, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again.

Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the class you chose: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

### Martial Adept

You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the [[Battle Master archetype]] in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

### Medium Armor Master

_Prerequisite: Proficiency with medium armor_

You have practiced moving in medium armor to gain the following benefits:

You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and aren’t [[incapacitated]], you gain the following benefits:

- You have [[advantage]] on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Observant

Quick to notice details of your environment, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- If you can see a creature’s mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it’s saying by reading its lips.
- You have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom ([[Perception]]) and passive Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) scores.

### Polearm Master

You gain the following benefits:

- When you take the [[Attack]] action and attack with only a [[glaive]], [[halberd]], [[quarterstaff]], or [[spear]], you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon’s damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage.
- While you are wielding a [[glaive]], [[halberd]], [[pike]], [[quarterstaff]], or [[spear]], other creatures provoke an [[opportunity attack]] from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.

### Resilient

Choose one ability score. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase the chosen ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in saving throws using the chosen ability.

### Ritual Caster

_Prerequisite: Intelligence or Wisdom 13 or higher_

You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.

When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice. Choose one of the following classes: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You must choose your spells from that class’s spell list, and the spells you choose must have the ritual tag. The class you choose also determines your spellcasting ability for these spells: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical [[spell scroll]] or a wizard’s spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the spell list for the class you chose, the spell’s level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

### Savage Attacker

Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice and use either total.

### Sentinel

You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy’s guard, gaining the following benefits:

- When you hit a creature with an [[opportunity attack]], the creature’s [[speed]] becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
- Creatures provoke [[opportunity attacks]] from you even if they take the [[Disengage]] action before leaving your reach.
- When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn’t have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

### Sharpshooter

You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

- Attacking at long range doesn’t impose [[disadvantage]] on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore [[half cover]] and [[three-quarters cover]].
- Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a –5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.

### Shield Master

You use shields not just for protection but also for offense. You gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield:
