Parvius was wizard that did my teleportation - they are sorry it’s going to take longer 
Large fluctuation of magical energy recently

HVT surge from one they were looking after
Don’t engage now  

Not too far from the target from not dead on  

200 consumed, others dead 

Thrain the leader of village
The disc, elevator overtaken by constructs, miles wide, North East  

Ruins to the east
Fungus forrest near the ruins  

Dhoruid Thundermace  

Killed a mf Chimera   

Fighting the Chimera
Dummies jump down water slide
We search forever

Slemolk the Goblin  

A bat hanging from the ceiling, has to be about 12-15ft long
Reflection with scar, wears red bandana, more scars, different hair, but is my face  

Icy hell scape, weird eldritch being
Can give oddly helpful insights, crossing has not been done  

Parvius gott in touch
Where they were trying to send me was far from where I ended up because the region I am in has an anomaly disrupting the weave, fall in it like a drain hole. I have been subject to it.  

Look out for magical architecture, investigate it  

CXC74
XC789  

Disc is multiple miles wide, has a control panel for 4 finger hand. Mesmerizing array of buttons, emanates energy drawing us closer.

- Alien language  

Bellreach in the moon territory (half a continent away, 500 miles)  

Astrid Thrain-ogden (human) - Dane’s Mother  

Dawn breaks  

Water is running out
Talking about getting government and militia set up

No government
We are more in emergency mode
Let the leaders sit on a council, focus on providing
Free regatia, fairy boys, the tall hat gang, the elder, steam hart

Businesses taking a hit
Arcane shop is shifting to salvaging but will be dominated by the bazar, Book store (inkwell), archive, mythical menagerie (but always has resources somehow)   
1. Finding a source of water
2. Find food sourcing 
3. Set up the council 
4. Find some sort of civilized life, maybe trade
5. Biggest threat
6. Keeping the economy propped up
7. Then getting out of here 

Break into room
Kill two guys talking about cult behavior
Brain possesses Cedrick
Went into room, nothing to see
Went into another room, found crystal, 
Dumbass Cedrick goes into room but we serve some whoop ass
Find new room with weird cult speech 
Found a room of alcohol, was cold but unknown why
Accidentally walked in on some training room
Found a bath with some sort of royal insignia (Language almost seems elven) 
Weird undead comes out of box
- Told us about Minastria 
- Said he ended up in box from being on a table because of negative result, non-psionic, examined for innate potential for undead forms no suitable form besides biomass
- Song of ages, chosen are meant to sing it to shape reality to whims, needs enough members
- Servants of the masters, don’t see their faces but their whispers, servants of conductors 
- A chance of ascension 
- Zion goes off on his own, like a dumbass

Found brain who told us about the phantom warriors and Spector soldiers
Pointy stick evolution
Chosen if you hear the call
Fell down from fireplace 
Slipped from fingers and fell into the hole  

“Welcome to the sacred gathering where the echoes of existence weave together in harmonious threads. Today, we embark on a journey to join the celestial choir, where every note resonates with the pulse of the cosmos.  

Embrace the melody of the ages, for within the cadence of time lies the key to unlocking the secrets of the Great Beyond. Each of you is a note in the grand symphony of the universe, and together, we shall create a masterpiece that transcends mortal comprehension.  

Let the song of ages guide you, as you become one with the cosmic vibrations. Shed the shackles of the mundane and elevate your essence to resonate with the divine frequencies. In the harmony of unity, we find the true essence of existence, and in the choir, we discover the power to shape reality itself.  

Join hands, fellow travelers, and let the music of the cosmos flow through your very being. As you sing the song of ages, remember that you are not merely a spectator but an integral part of the cosmic performance. We shall transcend the boundaries of the mundane and ascend to the sublime realms of the Great Beyond.”
