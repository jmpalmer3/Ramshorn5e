## Abomination _Solitary, Large, Construct, Terrifying_

Slam (d10+3 damage) 20 HP 1 Armor

_Close, Reach, Forceful_

**Special Qualities:** Many limbs, heads, and so on

Corpses sewn onto corpses make up the bulk of these shambling masses of dark magic. Most undead are crafted to be controlled—made to serve some purpose like building a tower or serving as guardians. Not so the abomination. The last aspect of the ritual used to grant fire to their hellish limbs invokes a hatred so severe that the abomination knows but one task: to tear and rend at the very thing it cannot have—life. Many students of the black arts learn to their mortal dismay the most important fact about these hulks; an abomination knows no master. _Instinct_: To end life

-   Tear flesh apart
-   Spill forth putrid guts
