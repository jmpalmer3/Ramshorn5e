Tail whip (d6+1 damage) 11 HP 2 Armor

_Close, Reach_

**Special Qualities:** Vampire spawn

“Aswang-hound and hopping whip-tail! Sent by vampires on their two, twisted legs, these ugly things look like the head of a rat or a crocodile, maybe, furry though and sharp of tooth. They have withered wings, but cannot use them and long, whipping tails, spurred with poison tips. Stupid, vengeful and mischievous they cause all kinds of chaos when let out of the strange clay jars in which they’re born. Only a vampire could love such a wretched thing.” _Instinct_: To disturb

-   Poison them
-   Do a vampire’s bidding
