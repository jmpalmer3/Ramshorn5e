**Guardsman** Group, Intelligent, Organized 
6 HP 1 Armor 
Spear (d8 damage) Close, Reach 

Noble protector or merely drunken lout, it often makes no difference to these sorts. Falling shy of a noble knight, the proud town guard is an ancient profession nonetheless. These folks of the constabulary often dress in the colors of their lord (when you can see it under the mud) and, depending on the richness of that lord, might even have a decent weapon and some armor that fits. Those are the lucky ones. Even so, someone has to be there to keep an eye on the gate when the Black Riders have been spotted in the woods. Too many of us owe our lives to these souls—remember that the next time one is drunkenly insulting your mother, hmm? 

Instinct: To do as ordered 
• Uphold the law 
• Make a profit
___
**Soldier** Horde, Intelligent, Organized 
3 HP 1 Armor 
Spear (d6 damage) Close, Reach 

For a commoner with a strong arm, sometimes it’s this or be a bandit. It’s wear the colors and don ill-fitting armor and march into the unknown with a thousand other scared men and women conscripted to fight the wars of our time. They could be hiding out in the woods instead, living off poached elk and dodging the king’s guard. Better to risk one’s life in service to a cause. To bravely toss one’s lot in with one’s fellows and hope to come out the other side still in one piece. Besides, the nobles need strong men and women. What is it they say? A handful of soldiers beats a mouthful of arguments. 

Instinct: To fight 
• March into battle 
• Fight as one
___
**Knight** Solitary, Intelligent, Organized, Cautious 
12 HP 4 Armor 
Sword (b[2d10] damage) Close 

What youngster doesn’t cling to the rail at the mighty joust, blinded by the sun on their glittering armor, wishing they could be the one adorned in steel and riding to please the King and Queen? What peasant youth with naught but a loaf of bread and a lame sow doesn’t wish to trade it all in for the lance and the bright pennant? A knight is many things—a holy warrior, a sworn sword, a villain sometimes, too, but a knight cannot help but be a symbol to all who see her. A knight means something. 

Instinct: To live by a code 
• Make a moral stand 
• Lead soldiers into battle
