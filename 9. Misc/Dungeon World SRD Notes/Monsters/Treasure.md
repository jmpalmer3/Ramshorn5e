Monsters, much like adventurers, collect shiny useful things. When the players search the belongings of a monster (be they on their person or tucked away somewhere) describe them honestly. 

If the monster has accumulated some wealth you can roll that randomly. Start with the monster’s damage die, modified if the monster is: 
• **Hoarder:** roll damage die twice, take higher result 
• **Far from home:** add at least one ration (usable by anyone with similar taste) 
• **Magical:** some strange item, possibly magical 
• **Divine:** a sign of a deity (or deities) 
• **Planar:** something not of this earth 
• **Lord over others:** +1d4 to the roll 
• **Ancient and noteworthy:** +1d4 to the roll 

Roll the monster’s damage die plus any added dice to find the monster’s treasure: 
	1: A few coins, 2d8 or so 
	2: An item useful to the current situation 
	3: Several coins, about 4d10 
	4: A small item (gem, art) of considerable value, worth as much as 2d10×10 coins, 0 weight 
	5: Some minor magical trinket 
	6: Useful information (in the form of clues, notes, etc.) 
	7: A bag of coins, 1d4×100 or thereabouts. 1 weight per 100. 
	8: A very valuable small item (gem, art) worth 2d6×100, 0 weight 
	9: A chest of coins and other small valuables. 1 weight but worth 3d6×100 coins. 
	10: A magical item or magical effect 
	11: Many bags of coins for a total of 2d4×100 or so 
	12: A sign of office (crown, banner) worth at least 3d4×100 coins 
	13: A large art item worth 4d4×100 coins, 1 weight 
	14: A unique item worth at least 5d4×100 coins 
	15: All the information needed to learn a new spell and roll again 
	16: A portal or secret path (or directions to one) and roll again 
	17: Something relating to one of the characters and roll again 
	18: A hoard: 1d10×1000 coins and 1d10×10 gems worth 2d6×100 each
