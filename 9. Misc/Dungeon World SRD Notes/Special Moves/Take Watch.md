*When you’re on watch and something approaches the camp* roll+Wis. *On a 10+*, you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a response, everyone in the camp takes +1 forward. *On a 7–9*, you react just a moment too late; your companions in camp are awake but haven’t had time to prepare. They have weapons and armor but little else. *On a miss*, whatever lurks outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.
