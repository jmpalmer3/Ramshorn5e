*When you have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7*, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills. 
• Subtract your current level+7 from your XP. 
• Increase your level by 1. 
• Choose a new advanced move from your class. 
• If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook. 
• Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.
