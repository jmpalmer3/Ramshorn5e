*When you return triumphant and throw a big party*, spend 100 coins and roll +1 for every extra 100 coins spent. *On a 10+*, choose 3. *On a 7–9*, choose 1. *On a miss*, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how). 
• You befriend a useful NPC. 
• You hear rumors of an opportunity. 
• You gain useful information. 
• You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked.
