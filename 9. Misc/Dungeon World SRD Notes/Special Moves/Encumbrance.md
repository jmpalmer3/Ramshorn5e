*When you make a move while carrying weight you may be encumbered.* If your weight carried is: 
• Equal to or less than your Load, you suffer no penalty 
• Less than or equal to your Load+2, you take -1 ongoing until you lighten your burden 
• Greater than your Load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail 
___

A PC’s Load stat is determined by their class and Str. Being able to haul more is a clear benefit when trying to carry treasure out of a dungeon or just making sure you can bring along what you need. 

This move only applies to things a person could walk around with and still act. Carrying a boulder on your back is not encumbrance— you can’t really act or move much with it. It affects what moves you can make appropriately in the fiction.
