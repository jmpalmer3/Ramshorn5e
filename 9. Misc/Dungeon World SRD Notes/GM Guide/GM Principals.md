• Describe the situation 
• Follow the rules
• Make moves 
• Exploit your prep

**Agenda**
• Portray a fantastic world 
• Fill the characters’ lives with adventure 
• Play to find out what happens

Dungeon World adventures never presume player actions.

**Principles**
• Draw maps, leave blanks
• Address the characters, not the players
• Embrace the fantastic
• Make a move that follows
• Never speak the name of your move
• Give every monster life
• Name every person
• Ask questions and use the answers
• Be a fan of the characters
• Think dangerous
• Begin and end with the fiction
• Think offscreen, too

When you make a move what you’re actually doing is taking an element of the fiction and bringing it to bear against the characters. Your move should always follow from the fiction. They help you focus on one aspect of the current situation and do something interesting with it. What’s going on? What move makes sense here?

If you don’t know something, or you don’t have an idea, ask the players and use what they say.

Everything can be put in danger, everything can be destroyed. Nothing you create is ever protected.

Everything you and the players do in Dungeon World comes from and leads to fictional events. When the players make a move, they take a fictional action to trigger it, apply the rules, and get a fictional effect. When you make a move it always comes from the fiction.
