If a bad thing happens to you that doesn't cause damage, it's probably a debility. It could be a more specific tag.

**Weak (STR)**: You can’t exert much force. Maybe it’s just fatigue and injury, or maybe your strength was drained by magic. 
**Shaky (DEX)**: You’re unsteady on your feet and you’ve got a shake in your hands.
**Sick (CON):** Something just isn’t right inside. Maybe you’ve got a disease or a wasting illness. Maybe you just drank too much ale last night and it’s coming back to haunt you. 
**Stunned (INT):** That last knock to the head shook something loose. Brain not work so good. 
**Confused (WIS):** Ears ringing. Vision blurred. You’re more than a little out of it. 
**Scarred (CHA):** It may not be permanent, but for now you don’t look so good.

Not every attack inflicts a debility—they’re most often associated with magic, poison, or stranger things like a vampire sucking your blood. Each debility is tied to an ability and gives you -1 to that ability’s modifier. The ability’s score is unaffected so you don’t have to worry about changing your maximum HP when you’re sick. 

You can only have each debility once. If you’re already Sick and something makes you Sick you just ignore it. 

Debilities are harder to heal than HP. Some high level magic can do it, sure, but your best bet is getting somewhere safe and spending a few days in a soft, warm bed. Of course, debilities are both descriptive and prescriptive: if something happens that would remove a debility, that debility is gone. 

Debilities don’t replace descriptions and using the established fiction. When someone loses an arm that doesn’t mean they’re Weak, it means they have one less arm. Don’t let debilities limit you. A specific disease can have whatever effects you can dream up. Sick is just a convenient shorthand for some anonymous fever picked up from a filthy rat.
