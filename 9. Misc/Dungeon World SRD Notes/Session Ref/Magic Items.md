When making your own magic items keep in mind that these items are magical. Simple modifiers, like+1 damage, are the realm of the mundane—magic items should provide more interesting bonuses.

**Tricksy Rope** 1 weight 
	A rope that listens. Does tricks, too, like a smart and more obedient snake might. Tell it “Coil” or “Slack” or “Come here, rope” and it will.

**Sacred Herbs** 0 weight 
	The sacred herbs, collected and prepared by an order of lost wizardmonks, can be found in bundles with two or three uses to them. Kept dry, they last indefinitely. When smoked in a pipe or consumed in an incense burner and the thick, blue smoke inhaled, these herbs will grant you strange visions of faraway places and distant times. *If you focus your will on a particular person, place or thing*, the herbs will respond: roll+WIS. *On a 10+*, the vision is clear and useful— yielding some valid information. *On a 7–9*, the vision is about the thing desired, but is unclear, fraught with metaphor or somehow difficult to understand. *On a miss*, the GM will ask you, “What is it you fear most?” You must answer honestly, of course.

**Earworm Wax** 1 use, 0 weight 
	A yellowish candle. Seems never to burn out and the light it casts is strange and weak. Its wax is always cool, too. Drip the wax into the ear of a target and gain 3 hold. Spend that hold and ask your target a question. They find themselves telling you the whole truth, despite themselves. The consequences, after the fact? Those are up to you to deal with.

**Bag of Holding** 0 weight ]
	A bag of holding is larger on the inside than the outside, it can contain an infinite number of items, and its weight never increases. When you try to retrieve an item from a bag of holding, roll+WIS. *On a 10+*, it’s right there. *On a 7-9*, choose one: 
	• You get the exact item, but it takes a while 
	• You get a similar item of the GM’s choice, but it only takes a moment No matter how many items it contains, a bag of holding is always 0 weight.
	
**Axe of the Conqueror-King** Close, 1 weight 
	It is crafted of shining steel, glowing with a golden light and imbued with mythical powers of authority. When you bear the axe, you become a beacon of inspiration to all you lead. Any hirelings in your employ have +1 Loyalty, no matter the quality of your leadership.

**Arrows of Acheron** 1 ammo, 1 weight 
	Crafted in darkness by a blind fletcher, these arrows can find their target in even the deepest darkness. An archer may fire them blind, in the dark, with his eyes bound by heavy cloth and still be assured of a clean shot. If the light of the sun ever touches the arrows, however, they come apart like shadows and dust.

**The Carcosan Spire** Reach, Thrown, 3 weight 
	None know from whence this spear of twisted white coral comes. Those who bear it too long find their minds full of alien dreams and begin to hear the strange thoughts of the Others. None are impervious. Used against any “natural” target (men, goblins, owlbears and the like) the Spire acts as a mere mortal spear. Its true purpose is to do harm to those things whose strange natures protect them against mundane weapons. Used thus, the Spire can wound foes otherwise invulnerable to harm. The wielder will recognize these twisted foes on sight—the Spire knows its own.

**Flask of Breath** 0 weight 
	A simple thing, but useful when you need a breath of fresh air. The flask appears empty but cannot be filled, anything added to it simply spills out. This is because the flask is eternally full of air. If placed underwater, it will bubble forever. If pressed to the mouth, one can breathe normally—smoke is no concern, for example. I’m sure you’ll find all sorts of unusual uses for it.

**The Epoch Lens** 1 weight 
	An archmage, old and too frail to leave his tower, crafted this intricate and fragile device of glass and gold to examine the histories and relics he so loved. Looking at an object through the lens reveals visions of who made it and where it came from.

**Lodestone Shield** +1 armor, 1 weight 
	What mixed-up dummy made this? Shields are meant to repel metal, not draw it in! Emblazoned with a lion rampant, the Lodestone Shield has the power to pull blades and arrows to it. When you defend against enemies using metal weapons you can spend one hold, per target, to disarm them. Also, sometimes you’ll find a handful of loose change stuck to it.

**Lamented Memento** 0 weight 
	Taking the form of a single lock of bright red hair, bound in a black ribbon and immune to the ravages of time, the Lamented Memento bears a grim enchantment. In it are the memories and emotions of a girl who dealt with Death at the Black Gates so many times that, in the end, they fell in love and she left the world to be with him for a time. Her memory protects the wielder. If he finds himself at the Gates, the Memento can be traded for an automatic result of 10+ on the last breath move.
	
**Tears of Annalise** 0 weight 
	Cloudy red gemstones the size of a thumbnail, the Tears of Annalise are always found in pairs. When swallowed by two different people, they bind the swallowers together—when either feels strong emotions (particularly sadness, loss, fear or desire) the other feels it, as well. The effects last until one spills the blood of the other
	
**Teleportation Room** Slow 
	James Ninefingers, eccentric genius mage, created these room-sized magical apparati. A stone chamber etched with runes and scribblings, glowing with a faint blue light. *When you enter and say aloud the name of a location*, roll+INT. *On a 10+*, you arrive exactly where you’d intended. *On a 7–9*, the GM chooses a safe location nearby. *On a miss*, you end up someplace. Maybe it’s nearby? It’s definitely not safe. Strange things sometimes happen to those who bend time and space with these devices.

**Titus’ Truthful Tallow** 0 weight 
	A candle of ivory- and copper-colored tallow with a wick of spun silver. When lit, none upon whom its light falls is able to tell a lie. They may keep silent or dissemble but when asked a question directly, they can speak naught but truth.
	
**Violation Glaive** Reach, 2 weight 
	A legendary blade, said to have been thrust backwards in time from some grim future, the violation glaive is crafted of strange green iron. The blade strikes at the mind of those it wounds, as well as the body. When you hack and slash on a 10+ you have an additional option: you can deal your normal damage, let them counterattack you, and instill the emotion of your choice (maybe fear, reverence, or trust).
