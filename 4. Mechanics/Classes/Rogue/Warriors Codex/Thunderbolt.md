### Thunderbolt

While most rogues favor stealth and subterfuge, others favor shock and awe. These aptly-named Thunderbolts, charged with elemental lightning, are one such group. As one of their number, you reject stealth and instead surge from one target to the next in a blinding display that leaves survivors dazzled and your enemies burned to death.

#### Electrical Charge

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, electricity courses through your body. You can use an action to transform into a living bolt of lightning and move in any direction of your choice, expending movement as normal. In this state, opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage, you have advantage on checks against effects that grapple or restrain, and you can move through other creatures.

You return to your normal state if you stop moving or change direction. If you do so inside another creature, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.

When you move through a creature or return to normal within 5 feet of one, you can attack it as part of the same action. You can inflict your Sneak Attack against the target without having advantage on the roll, though all the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply. When you inflict Sneak Attack in this way, it deals lightning damage instead of your weapon's.

#### Ride the Lightning

Starting at 3rd level, your attunement to electricity allows you move and speak like an elemental being. You gain the following benefits:

- You can glide through the air, borne by lingering charge. The length of your long jumps and the height of your high jumps is doubled.
- Because you stream through water like electricity, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can speak, read, and write Auran.

#### Flow of the Current

Starting at 9th level, you flow like lightning through conductive objects. When you touch a wet or metallic object while in your Electrical Charge form, you can move within its metal components or along its wet surface, expending movement as normal. Your Electrical Charge form shrinks to fit within the object or surface if it is smaller than you.

If you change direction when moving in this way, you maintain your Electrical Charge form. You can exit the object in any unoccupied space that you can reach with your remaining movement, and can leave as a lightning bolt that travels in any direction or in your normal form. If you run out of movement or end your turn in the object, you are ejected into the nearest available space.

#### Thunder Child

Starting at 13th level, the electricity that courses through your body just beneath the surface grants you the ability to move like an elemental of the storm. You have resistance to lightning, thunder, and falling damage, and can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot without squeezing. You can also enter another creature's space and stop there. Until you or that creature leave that space, any attack that misses you targets that creature instead.

#### Bolt from the Blue

Starting at 17th level, you can use a bonus action to teleport to any point you can see by transforming into a lightning bolt that streaks into the air and crashes down at the point with a flash and roar of thunder that all creatures within 5 miles can see and hear. All creatures and objects within 5 feet of the point take 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage.

To use this feature, both you and the point you choose must be outdoors. Anything you are wearing or carrying, including one additional creature that you are grappling, is transformed into lightning for the duration as well, but nothing that you bring with you takes damage when you land.
