### Blink

The legendary Blinks are master pickpockets with a supernatural knack for concealment. With a portal to a personal demiplane manifested in your hand, you join their ranks, able to make contraband vanish in the blink of an eye.

#### Palm Portal

After you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use an action to touch a Medium or smaller object and spirit it away into a demiplane that only you can access.

You can use a bonus action to pull a Small or smaller object that you can see 30 feet straight toward you and into your empty hand. If a creature or another object impedes its progress, it stops harmlessly and falls to the ground.

If another creature is wearing or carrying the object, you must use your action to hit the creature with an unarmed strike. to take it. You can use your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll, which you are proficient in. This attack deals no damage.

You can withdraw an object in your demiplane as an action, though you can withdraw a weapon from your demiplane as part of the attack you make with it. The demiplane holds weight no greater than your carrying capacity. At 13th and 17th levels in this class, its capacity doubles.

When you or a creature within 10 feet of you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to divert the projectile or spell, imposing disadvantage on the roll. If the attack misses, you pull the projectile into your demiplane.

On your next turn, you can use an action to reverse the projectile or spell, making a ranged weapon attack against a target using the original attack's range. You are proficient in the attack, and if you inflict your Sneak Attack damage, it deals force damage instead of the projectile's type.

You must have an empty hand to use any of these features.

#### Planar Interference

Starting at 9th level, energy leaks from your demiplane, interfering with attempts to perceive you. You can use an action to channel a portal through your empty hand and leave it open, as though you were concentrating on a spell. You can close the portal at any time, no action required.

While the portal is active, Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to perceive you are made with disadvantage, and you are under the effects of the _nondetection_ spell.

#### Pocket Prison

Starting at 13th level, you can target a Medium or smaller creature with the unarmed strike granted by your Palm Portal feature. If the attack hits, the target takes 2d6 force damage and is pulled into your demiplane.

While in the demiplane, it is unharmed and takes turns and actions as normal, but it is blinded and deafened until freed. The target is released at the start of your next turn, or when you pull another creature inside. When released, the target reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.

#### Singularity

Beginning at 17th level, you are always under the effects of the _blink_ spell whenever you are conscious, unless you choose to suppress it.
