# Rogue

Elusive and evasive, rogues are masters of many talents and move in many circles. Their archetypes categorize and specialize them even further. Those listed here improve two of the weakest archetypes and add several more.

## Updated Class Features

The following entries detail changes and enhancements to various rogue features.

#### New Proficiencies

You gain the additional proficiencies listed below.  
_**Weapons.**_ Arming sword, bastard sword, estoc, garotte wire, longsword, parrying dagger, rondel, sabre.  
_**Armor.**_ Medium armor.  
_**Shields.**_ Buckler.

### Psychic Blades

_3rd-level Soulknife feature_ Psychic Blades works as written, with the following change: Before you make an attack with your Psychic Blade, you can apply one of the following properties to that attack: _bypass, finisher, nonlethal, prone fighting, skewering, slicing, staggering,_ or _sundering._

You can no longer make a second attack with your psychic blade as a bonus action; instead you can make a second attack as if you were engaging in two-weapon fighting.

### Sneak Attack

_1st-level rogue feature_  
Sneak Attack works as written, with the following change:  
The attack that triggers Sneak Attack can use an arming sword, bastard sword, longsword, or any weapon with the _finesse, light,_ or _ranged_ properties.

#### Spellcasting Focus

_3rd-level Arcane Trickster feature_  
You can use an arcane focus (found in Chapter 5 of the   
_PHB_) as a focus for your wizard spells.

#### Use Magic Device

_13th-level Thief feature_  
You have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, level, and alignment requirements on the use of magic items.
