#### Monsters and Death

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall [[unconscious]] and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall [[unconscious]] and follow the same rules as player characters.
