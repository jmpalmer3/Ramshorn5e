# VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID

If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.

_**Squares.**_ Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.

_**Speed.**_ Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.

If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.

_**Entering a Square.**_ To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg) provides guidance on using a [more realistic approach](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#UsingMiniatures).)

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain) does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

_**Corners.**_ Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

_**Ranges.**_ To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
