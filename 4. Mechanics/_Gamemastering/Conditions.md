# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [blinded](Conditions#Blinded), are impairments, but a few, such as [invisible](Conditions#Invisible), can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [prone](Conditions#Prone) condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## Blinded

- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have [advantage](<Abilities#Advantage and Disadvantage>), and the creature's attack rolls have [disadvantage](<Abilities#Advantage and Disadvantage>).

## Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 3     | [Disadvantage](<Abilities#Advantage and Disadvantage>) on attack rolls and [saving throws](<Abilities#Saving Throws>) |
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 5     | [Speed](Adventuring#Speed) reduced to 0                                                                                                                                            |
| 6     | Death                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its [speed](Adventuring#Speed) halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1.

## Frightened

- A frightened creature has [disadvantage](<Abilities#Advantage and Disadvantage>) on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
- The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
