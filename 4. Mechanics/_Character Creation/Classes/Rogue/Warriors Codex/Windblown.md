### Windblown

Some train from youth to be fast. Others use magic to enhance their speed. And still others have an innate supernatural edge. Operating on instinct and reflex, their eternal tailwind pushes them on. These are the Windblown, who favor hit-and-run tactics with the wind at their back.

#### Fleet of Foot

Starting at 3rd level, you move quickest when fleeing from enemies. Your speed increases by 5 feet. When you Disengage, you can attempt to shove one creature within your reach as part of the same action.

You can also use your Dexterity modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, when you make an Athletics check to shove a creature.

When you reach 13th level in this class, you can also Toss one creature within your reach when you Disengage even if you haven't grappled that creature, and can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength when you make the check to Toss it and calculate the distance it is thrown.

#### Wind Beneath My Wings

Starting at 9th level, the climate always favors you. As long as you aren't inside or underground, you have advantage on Survival checks made to navigate, and your speed increases by 10 feet. You and creatures with you cannot be slowed by poor weather during travel, though other factors may still reduce your pace. In strong winds, you have advantage on ranged attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, rather than disadvantage.
