### Exemplar

The archetypal Exemplar is a simple, mighty warrior who combines raw power with rigorous training. Regardless of the weapons they wield, an Exemplar displays martial prowess honed to deadly perfection. They might be even more effective than other warriors using the tried-and-true, or experiment with a variety of bizarre weapons and exotic fighting styles.

To them, it matters little: to be an Exemplar is to make any warrior archetype possible. Masters of any weapon they find, or even items never meant to be weapons, Exemplar are larger-than-life inspirations who are never without a weapon and whose inhuman endurance means they are always ready for battle.

#### Strike True

You are the master of every weapon and every fighting  
form. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you  
gain proficiency in all exotic weapons and shields, and in  
improvised weapons. Any weapon you wield has a damage die of 1d8 while you use it, unless it already uses a larger  
die or multiple damage dice. Finally, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. This expands to include a roll of 18 at 15th level in this class.

#### Remarkable Athlete

Starting at 7th level, you add your proficiency bonus to all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks you make that you are not already proficient in, and to the length of your long jumps and height of your high jumps. You gain proficiency in your choice of Athletics or Acrobatics, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using your choice. In addition, your speed increases by 5 feet.

#### Empowered Fighting Styles

At 10th level, you become a master of your chosen styles of combat. Choose one additional fighting style from the options presented to you. Both your choice and the fighting style you gained at 1st level in this class grant you additional benefits, which are listed below.

**Archery.** Once per turn when you make a ranged weapon attack roll and miss, you can reroll the attack roll against a new target within 5 feet of the original.

**Blind Fighting.** You have truesight out to a range of 10 feet.

**Defense.** You gain an additional +1 bonus to AC while wearing armor, and you don and doff armor in half the time.

**Dueling.** When wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you can use a bonus action to attempt to disarm a creature when you hit it with that weapon.

**Flexibility.** You gain both benefits of this fighting style anytime you are wielding a weapon, regardless of whether you hold it in one or two hands.

**Great Weapon Fighting.** When you attack with a melee weapon held in two hands, you can grant that attack the _sundering_ or _sweeping_ property. Additionally, if your size is Small, you wield _heavy_ weapons without penalties.

**Interception.** If you successfully reduce the damage of the intercepted attack to an amount less than your fighter level, the target of the attack takes no damage instead.

**Protection.** If you impose disadvantage on an attack roll and it misses, you can make one melee weapon attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.

**Superior Technique.** You learn another maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype, and gain an additional superiority die.

**Thrown Weapon Fighting.** When you hit with an attack with a thrown weapon, you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you in a straight line.

**Two-Weapon Fighting.** When you miss an attack with a weapon that you are are holding in one hand, you gain advantage on the next attack you make against the same target with the weapon you are holding in your other hand, so long as you make both attacks on the same turn.

**Unarmed Fighting.** When you have a creature grappled, you can make a new Strength (Athletics) check against the target's opposed Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check in place of one of your attacks. On a success, the target is restrained and your speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

#### Final Stand

Starting at 15th level, your indomitable will lets you power through mortal injuries. When you succeed on a death saving throw, you can choose to regain 1 hit point. When you do so, your current level of exhaustion is reduced by 1, you stand without consuming any movement, and can take your turn as normal.

Creatures of your choice that can see you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your fighter level + your Charisma modifier. After you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you do so again.

#### Survivor

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain a number of hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
