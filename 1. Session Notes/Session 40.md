## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 39#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

Zion shows up as we are going through the Labyrinth claiming to have been teleported away by [[Havra the Scholar]] where he gained a new ability that would help find Dane's father.  

We run into a wall with seemingly a dozen different paths. Zion looks around and seemed to see some blood that didn't lead anywhere. Cedrick listens to the walls/ground and hears the rumbling is deeper within the paths. 

Garrin finds a faint symbol of [[Nysara]]. 

We chose a path and run into a room with a skeleton, Cedrick hears a faith reptilian sound around the ceiling. A hydra falls from the ceiling. We fight it, Cedrick getting a quad feed with a single bolt. Then another hydra drops from the ceiling. Finally a third one drops, which we also kill. 

We find a letter that says  

```  
**Journal Entry: Day 23 - The Labyrithn of Nysara** 

Today marks the twenty-third day of my expedition, and I find myself deeper within the enigmatic Labyrinth of Nysara. My heart pounds with a mix of trepidation and excitement, for I am closer than ever to uncovering the Lost Sanctuary, rumored to lie at the center of the Arcane Ley-Lines. My goal is clear—to harness the sanctuary’s mystical energies and craft an enchantment that will both cure and bestow immortality upon my loyal pet alligator, Gharu. The labyrinth is a daunting maze of winding corridors and shifting walls, but my determination remains unshaken.  
  
**Journal Entry: Day 24 - Lost in the Labyrinth**  
  
The labyrinth has proven to be an even greater challenge than I anticipated. Every turn seems to lead me deeper into a maze of confusion. My supplies are dwindling, and my hope wavers. As I navigate through the narrow passages, I can almost feel the arcane energies pulsating through the walls, guiding me and taunting me simultaneously. My map has become useless; the paths change too frequently for it to be of any help. I rely on my instincts and the faint glow of the ley-lines to find my way.  
  
**Journal Entry: Day 25 - Encounter with the Hydra**  
  
This morning, I encountered a sight that nearly cost me my life—a predatory Hydra. Its multiple heads and serpentine bodies emerged from the shadows, each head hissing and snapping in my direction. Fear gripped me, but so did an overwhelming sense of survival. I sprinted through the labyrinth, the Hydra in relentless pursuit. My heart raced as I turned corner after corner, hoping to lose the beast in the maze. I could hear Gharu's distressed growls from within my satchel, a reminder of why I embarked on this perilous journey.  
  
**Journal Entry: Day 26 - Chased Deeper into Darkness**  
  
The Hydra has not relented in its pursuit, driving me further into the depths of the labyrinth. Exhaustion weighs heavily on my body, but I cannot afford to rest. The labyrinth’s corridors have grown darker and more oppressive, the air thick with an unspoken menace. My torch flickers, casting eerie shadows on the stone walls. I’ve had to abandon my heavier gear to maintain my speed, leaving me with only the essentials. Gharu's presence is a comfort, a reminder of my mission's importance. I cannot fail him now, not when we are so close.

We go back down the path and go down the other path with the symbol. We find a blue elemental. We discuss for a long time on what to do, finally Cindril takes some water from the mana pool and the elemental attacks. We fight and win. Go through to the next room and find [[Gordos]] who is with the knight crusaders.
