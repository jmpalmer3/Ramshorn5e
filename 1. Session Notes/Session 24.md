## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 23]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

When we end up seeing [[Captain Ked]] we find [[Kozoc Ulmogo]] who is captured and injured escorted by [[bugbear|Bugbears]]. We meet a warlord named [[Warlord Kon]] who is part of the [[The Empire|The Imperium]]. 

Dane pets a Kruthik, which is a beast similar to a hobgoblin. These runes date back to long before history began in the untamed era. The exact owners of the place is unknown but must have been powerful arcanists. Magic of the place summoned the shard. 

Kon mentions their biggest enemies are corruption and injustice [[Arcanist Accord|The Accord]] and [[The Reclaimers]]. The entire agenda for the reclaimers have been brainwashed by the dragon overlords and then the accord split. There seems to be a magical field guarding a door that Kon and his compatriouts cannot get through. Dane touches the field and takes hella damage. Zion casts [[dispel-magic]] and opens the door. Kon allows them to go on ahead of them while they regroup. 

In the room they find a glowing orb at the end and two chests to either side of the room. [[Sol Siofra]] investigates it and takes damage while also injuring [[Cedrick Ballard]]. A similar thing happened with the other chest by [[Zion Dawnbreak]] lying to [[Sol Siofra]]. Finally [[Zion Dawnbreak]] messes with the orb which spawns three frog looking beasts. 

We dispel of the frogs and loot the area. This supplies us with a large purple orb that opens the door to a big loot room that Kon leads us through. There is the moon shard thing they were looking for and he takes it while we are left the loot. 

Met a strange hooded man named [[Bosso]]. Part of a group but won't tell us. Is against [[The Empire]]. He knew where we were from. 

The emperor leads the empire. He has doffed his former self. The ritual for an emperor to ascend eliminates the trace of the person until they a coronated and then they are only known as the emperor. Every bit of knowledge of them has been erased through magic.
