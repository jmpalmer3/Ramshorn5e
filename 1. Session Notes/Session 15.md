We approach a lone duergar with an average beard drinking away his pain, named Throndar, who believes us to be drunken hallucinations. Cedrick explains our situation to him in undercommon, and Dane insults him in common– which he apparently also understands.

Dane offers him a chance to escape his labor camp by helping us leave in exchange for us taking him to Ramshorn, which he doesn’t seem to understand and brushes off.

After some coaxing in the form of Dane completing his rock mushroom mining quota for the day, we camp for the night. Dane stays up with Throndar for first watch, and uses the time to tell him the tales of Cayden Cailean and also convince him to “speak the opposite” of how he feels about himself as the first step towards becoming “the shit”. During this conversation, Dane realizes that Cayden’s coin toss likely had nothing to do with the monster fight, but instead was meant to lead him to Stonedelve to free the duergar slaves. This conversation goes well enough, until Dane’s compassion eventually snaps and he gets a bit too honest, destroying whatever self-esteem Throndar had built. Dane wakes up Cedrick to take over watch and is a bit too noisy about it, wakes up everyone else, and then proceeds to slap Throndar into submission before going to sleep. 

In the morning, we set out and encountered a couple of duergar miners near the deposit point who hazed and bullied Throndar a bit. Dane takes this VERY poorly, beating and choking out one of them while the other watches. Dane then made the remaining duergar apologize and profess positive opinions of Throndar to his face, before collecting the unconscious body of his friend and skulking away.

We then made our way to Stonedelve, where we encountered the guard captain. Dane immediately starts causing problems, calling the captain’s city a “shit hole” to his face, and generally disturbs the peace. His friends try to talk the guard down, but Dane is inevitably arrested and sent to “the hole” near the barracks. 

As he’s taken away, the party talks their way out of the encounter and continue into the city, with Zion noting that Dane’s mention of the slaves in the prison was a likely hint that he’s planning to free the slaves or start a rebellion. They then continue on to the local stores where they meet Kara, gather information, and shop.

Meanwhile, in the hole, Dane is tossed into the cage with the duergar prisoners– notably being the only one in restraints– and the guards take their leave. Immediately, Dane starts his shit talking and asks for the biggest, baddest dude in the jail. He’s lead by the glances of the prisoners to a particular dwarf in the corner, with crossed arms like tree trunks. He tells Dane that his fighting days are long behind him, but if Dane continues then the duergar will take out their collective pent-up anger and pain on him in the form of a brutal beating. Dane accepts the challenge, explaining that he has to free them from slavery and it’s not up to him– he doesn’t want to be here doing this, but he has to– and that he only has to take out the leader for the rest to fall in line.

Dane is punched in the face by the big duergar as the others move to join in, and fights back in an attempt to knock out the leader as quickly as possible. Dane puts up a good fight, heavily damaging and nearly taking out the leader, but is eventually overwhelmed by the duergars’ sheer numbers and beaten unconscious.

Eventually, the group finishes their shopping and elect to check on Dane. After arriving at the barracks, they pay his fine using his own money and the guards bring Dane’s unconscious bloodied body out. His party decides to leave him unconscious out of fear of Dane starting more trouble, and head to a nearby tavern to rest and plan.
