![[Session 26]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


[[The Emperor]] begins to talk about an alliance they have with a similar town to [[Ramshorn]] . The forrest of this town has some strange disturbances that they believe is caused by the fey. He claims they have a ward for this area to protect the region and wants our help to help guard and protect it while it's being install. He will reward us with 1000gp and resources for buildings, such as an embassy. The town is known as [[Wall]] in the region of the [[Shadowy Gorge]]. He tells us to look for [[Clyde Odd]] who will construct the ward, he is in a fighting ring under [[Wall]]. 

The crew shops around a bit before heading out. It is a two day journey. Day one goes smoothly but during the night [[Zion Dawnbreak]] gets attacked by spiders. Day 2, they see something on the road and Cedrick goes to investigate. He gets attacked by snakes before they fight off and scare off the snakes. 

As they arrive into town, a new challenger approaches. They meet [[Cindril Odd]], a Human Barbarian who is native to the area. He shows him around and happens to be the son of the man they are looking for. He takes them down to the fight pit under the tavern to meet his father.
