Cedrick scouts ahead a bit and reports back about a tunnel further ahead, and an overlook about 20 feet up a sheer stone wall. After then sending Sol to scout the overlook, she discovers the sleeping Chimera and we devise a plan to send the party around the north tunnel that connects to the opposite end of the Chimera’s room and have Dane climb the overlook to prevent the beast from escaping. This plan immediately goes badly as both Sol and Zion trip over nearby rocks, waking the beast, and starting combat.

Cedrick catches the monster’s ire and its flame breath first, and is knocked unconscious almost immediately as the rest of the group catches up and Dane climbs the wall to flank the beast. Eventually, Cedrick is healed back up and poisons the Chimera, Zion debuffs it, and Dane grapples it, holding it inside Sol’s flaming sphere. Through sheer attrition and the creature’s inability to get free, it eventually dies of a mental aneurysm caused by Zion threatening to drag his balls across its face– which he immediately does as soon as the beast falls.

Dane, Zion, and Sol rush to round up the three Chimera eggs which Dane insists we give to the Dwarves who can do something more useful with them– and agrees to only Sol keeping one with the intent on hatching and raising it. We then butcher the animal for parts and loot its treasure hoard– with Dane finding and stowing the remains of a canvas featuring the leader of the Kineater prisoners.  

After deciding to set up camp for the day before heading out in the morning, Dane strips down to his trousers and climbs up the nearby aquifer tunnel. After 10 or so minutes of climbing/swimming, he eventually lets go and rides the current where he later discovers a drain back in the cave. He quickly hops out, returns to the party, and explains his plan to lower someone into the drain with a rope to see where it goes. Both Zion and Cedrick mysteriously disappear from the scene, and Sol is waffled into agreeing to being thrown in.

Both Dane and Sol pile their belongings and their clothes on the shore, and Sol is tossed in. Eventually, the current becomes too strong for the rope to sustain, and it snaps. Dane shouts down the tunnel that he’s lost Sol, hoping the others heard and understand the situation, and dives in after her. 

Zion and Cedrick stash Dane and Sol’s belongings under the corpse of the Chimera, and leave the cave in search of a potential water deposit where the two might have been sent. Zion makes brief contact with Dane via the Message cantrip, but receives a panicked “shut the fuck up, I’m getting Sol!” and loses him again.

Meanwhile, Sol and Dane are sent rocketing through the water tunnel and eventually ejected from the top of Stonedelve into the sewer moat. They decide to wash up and sleep in Dane’s room before heading back to the cave in the morning to reunite with the party, as Zion and Cedrick press through exhaustion in their Message-fueled search for them. Cedrick insists on continuing the search while Zion says the best course of action would be to rest up and gather a search party back in town for tomorrow. Cedrick goes off on his own, and soon finds a goblin named Slemolk mixing things around in a pot with cooking utensils, and speaks to them about his missing friends. Eventually, an uneasy Cedrick and Slemolk start heading back towards Zion at “camp”.
