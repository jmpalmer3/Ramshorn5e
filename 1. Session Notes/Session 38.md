## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 36#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


The gang is leaving a tavern 

Cedrick meets [[Havra the Second]], the asexual counter part of Havra. Cedrick talks to her about his past and how he has struggled with purpose and finding his place in the party. She asks him to bathe in a pool and as he goes under, he feels a crack form with heat emanating from it. Feels unrealized potential going in the pool. Cedrick wants further information and she recommends Sages in the Archanist Tower. He plans to come back to walk through a proper plan for learning and growing through yoga and meditation.  

The crew heads into the [[Crusaders Tower]] where they find [[Vlodus]] who is the smith who responds to no one. Dane tries to get his attention, but fails miserably before being pulled away by Garrin. [[The Meeting Room of the Brass]] is where the Brass (Leaders of the crusaders) deliberate. 

The crew then heads to the [[Arcanist Tower]] where they meet [[Speaker Zetarum]] who speaks for the law sages.

The sage knows what the book says, says where the temple is, we want to know where the temple is. [[Lost Sanctuary of Inera]]. The speaker is willing to give the location if we ensure at the end of their operation, the temple lie unmolested in control of [[Arcanist Accord]]. Temple is a mythical site, a fount of arcane power, allows close communion with [[Inera]] through magical text. 

Cindril goes in and talks with Havra the Second about his issue with his glasses and getting taken away. He was told it was the fey, the red leaf enclave. 

We head out to go to the tavern once again. Dane treats everyone to drinks. 

Talks to the [[Knight-Crusader Ademar]] about opening an embassy and he agrees
