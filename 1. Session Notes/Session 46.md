## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 46#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

Back at the wagon we find our horses missing and the bitches that we killed show up again. Sol goes firey again. 

We track down our horses and there is a note with them saying they were being borrowed by someone called [[Law Sage Agridalf]]

Then end up back with [[Garrin Branchfall]]'s mum while Sol tries to meditate to prevent explosion.
