## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 22]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

Dane chats with his father about his negative feelings about everyone wanting to be enemies and lack of friends and relationships. 

We are in the [[Skyward Saloon]], Dane later joins. They begin to discuss whether they should follow the scroll that [[Suhnar Muune]] gave Dane. They ask [[Fred]] about the Empire and he gives a general location. They decide to head in that direction and towards the ruins from the scroll to learn more about [[The Empire]].

They go through the [[Droughtstricken Plateau]] where they find ruins to an old city. There they also find a set of human men. They talk to them after scouting them out with Sol as a mouse, the men ran into an Apostate. These men say they are with the [[Arcanist Accord]]. 

Suddenly ambushed by lizard people. End up talking and forming a relationship with them, his name is [[Kozoc Ulmogo]]. This group focus on their control of magic and mages becoming sages. They prohibit certain forms of magic, specifically primal magic. [[Nysara]] is their God. 

The Calamity of Moon Fall, world was stirred up and exploring became hard over the seas. The only ones to navigate the seas are their fiercest rivals, [[The Free Mage Marauders]], they believe in mages being superior, but also the un-controlled use of magic. [[The Dwarves of Eheserin]], docile dwarves that is involved with the majority of trade with The Empire. Originally conquered by The Imperium, and almost every where else outside of places like the Gromlet. The lizard folk are all over the place, very aggressive, and like their own. The cities of the Accord are [[Frufast]] and several other smaller ones. 

We head out to find the imperium with Kozoc and his crew. We find a purple structure with some imperium flags. They scout the exterior to see what leads to the interior. They are on the hunt for one of the talismen. Run into a [[hobgoblin]] who takes them to another leader, [[Captain Ked]], who directs them to Warlord Kon. Ked gives us a sigil of the imperium.
