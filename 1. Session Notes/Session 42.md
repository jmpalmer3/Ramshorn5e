## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


[[Zion Dawnbreak]] uses monacle to see where [[Dane Ogden]]'s father is in a purple space with a city stuff. So Zion talks to Garrin about scrying him dad, so him draws him a picture and describes him. He manages to scry him and sees a tank of opaque liquid in a labyrinth of trees and roots. By a big hulking woman with 4 arms. 

We head back to where we were and Weaver shows up again with a warning. Says both corridors lead to the outside. Says that theres a trap from the pirates outside. Cedrick lies for a while but decides to reveal Weaver to the group. 

Weaver helps the gang teleport to Frufast. We talk to Elephant about [[The Ethereals]], When humans appeared they were new to the world and [[The Ethereals]] had led them. Arcanist consider it as blasphemous. Moon was destroyed, shattered everything, changed the world forever, most died, has been repopulated. 

[[The Ethereals]] showed up with humans thousands of years ago and led them here. 

End up in Ashgrove

We meet [[Enthyra Branchfall]]
