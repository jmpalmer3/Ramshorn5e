## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 24]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

The crew meets with the goblin hoard and are given a talisman to get across the sand wall. The crew decides to leave behind loot to come back for when they have a better mode of transportation. 

They also find a new friend that Sol connects with called Blue that looks like a magical bunny. 

[[Dane Ogden|Dane]] and [[Cedrick Ballard|Cedrick]] have a a heart to heart where Cedrick compliments him and then talks about how hard the transition has been and apologizes for any of his grumpy nature. Dane compliments him back and calls him a friend. After their touching moment, they find Sol and Zion together playing with Blue. 

Zion and Sol seem to be trusting Blue, but as Blue starts to speak to the party in their language, he send a message to Cedrick which Blue hears and responds to. This freaks out 
Zion and causes him to cast dispel magic which impacts him in some kind of way that he seems to act more like a normal rabbit. Sol gets pissy about it. 

Sol runs off and runs into a room with a big robot
