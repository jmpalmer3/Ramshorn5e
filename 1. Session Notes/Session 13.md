The fight continued with the fire elementals, and we find that Dramus’s fire has a special ability to damage fire immune creatures and that the elementals are allergic to fey bath water.   

Combat ends and we leave with the two cores, bicker for a while about nothing, somewhat assimilate Cedrick into our definitely-not-a-cult, and make our way south to the rental stand where we also discover Zion’s marriage issues may stem from infertility. 

While we set up camp outside the rental stand, Cedrick approaches Zion and shares a mutual vulnerability in that he also lost his wife and kids to his work– with her taking the kids and leaving him due to his hectic life schedule.

Meanwhile, Dramus tries to teach a drunk Sol and Dane how to play dragonchess who elect to put their own spin on the game. Copious amounts of drinking and shenanigans take place, Dramus’s coffee flask is unsuccessfully spiked with brandy, and we turn in for the night.

Waking up, more random bullshittery takes place, sidebars are invented, Operation: Turnt Dramus is initiated, our tires are heat treated once more, and we make our leave for the Lava Fortress.

After some pleading from Sol, Dane elects to let her drive. On the way, she makes a handful of successful jumps that impresses Dane and the group enough to let her continue driving, but upon reaching the final crevice before the Lava Fortress, Sol hits a small stone and sets the bus into a tumble down the canyon walls.
