## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 32]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


Cindril and Garrin got into the foundry where they found [[Gundren]] who is worried that they somehow made it into the Foundry without being accompanied. They are looking for someone who is able to translate the draconic language on the sphere found in one of tah's boys pockets. 

We finished the council meeting and met the two of them outside the town hall. Taking the stone, they argue on how to destroy it. They end up trying to brute force it. Cindril and Dane decide to pull on it, it blows up, and everyone gets injured besides Cedrick who was far away at the time. 

The squad decides to take it to the Foundry to see if [[Gundren]] has any idea what it was. He says it was some sort of navigation device. 

Zion is depressed about something and so they head to the skyward saloon so he can drink away his sorrows. Zion and Cedrick have a deep conversation about feeling important and being able to his their family. 

During this time Zion's wife, [[Victoria Dawnbreak]], and some random mushroom looking woman comes in. Zion confronts them, as Cedrick tries to hang low. The conversation doesn't go well, so they go back to the squad and inform them of what happened. 

The squad then moves back and goes into the lantern shop, where the Tabaxi, [[Shining Sky]], owner says she saw Dane's dad the night before and had a weird dream about him. 

We look for old bastard and start asking people if they had weird dreams like the Tabaxi. [[Eva Marley]] said she also had a dream about Dane's father. She saw Zion and Shining Sky. 

Garrin talks about a rumor when she was a kid about some choir
