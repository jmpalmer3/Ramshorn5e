Approaching the structure, an elf man drops out of a portal and introduces himself as [[Cedrick Ballard]]. We quickly adopt him, invite him on the bus (which he vandalizes immediately), and fill him in on our quest to get the hammer for the hat lady to get the lute for the bath lady to get magic bath water to heal Ramshorn.

Approaching the front entrance, the door is too small for the bus so we leave Sol behind to watch it while we enter the front door and are met with four obelisks marked in elemental runes– conveniently translated in chalk beneath them by someone who’s come before us– and a wall of fire blocking further passage.

Water Obelisk - Through flow, life adapts and thrives
Fire Obelisk - In transformation, destinies are forged anew
Earth Obelisk - From stability, all things are born
Air Obelisk - In movement, existence finds purpose 

Dramus guesses the order with some kind of philosophy– which is obviously wrong and makes the room explode– and then Cedric and Dane have identical guesses– which are obviously correct– and the wall of fire dissipates.  

We meet some guards– a couple of fire lizards– who demand an offering to speak to the hammer-er. We finesse our way through the conversation, and after Dramus and Cedric leave, Dane and Zion finesse their way into a conversation with the fire giant leader who explains he will part with the hammer when he completes the portal and offers us ways to help finish it: kill fire animals, fish them out of fissures, or retrieve the stolen batch that a necromancer absconded with. Zion and Dane settle on the necromancer and we all set off, but eventually give up on the necromancer and fish up four heart of fire fragments.

We then continued east to the volcano with the strange lava orb and encounter a large lava elemental of sorts that Zion attempts to communicate with. Remembering that the fire giant mentioned taking the hearts of the lava elementals at the volcano, we elect to attack them.
