Cedrick and Sol lament over Cedrick’s overconfidence and losing the wager, and Dramus is suddenly pulled through a flaming portal by a certain individual. Cedrick alerts the rest of the group, and the situation passes with only a few remarks.

Cedrick goes to check on Dane, and with encouragement from the rest of the group, we all head out so Dane can clear up the slavery situation with the captain of the guard. When we find him, Dane inquires as to what they mean by “slavery”, and is essentially told to speak to their leader– Thrane– and also apologizes for his previous outbursts after deciding he likes the captain as a person. Sol also chimes in and is met with a much friendlier demeanor from the Captain before we head to Thrane’s office– making a stop by the alchemist’s shop on the way to inform them of our slaying of the Ffej to collect future payment.

On the way, Cedrick is contacted for a second time by an unknown individual about his “sector” and their efforts to recover him, and Zion contracts Cedrick into a 1sp tax to take notes. We talk with Thrane, Dane insists that the “kin eaters” aren’t criminals but victims and that their survival is a testament to the heroics of those who sacrificed themselves so they could live and they shouldn’t be imprisoned, and Zion proses the idea of exiling them to the ruins to the east and collecting taxes from them rather than imprisonment. Thrane agrees to the possibility, and instead offers them their freedom, but in another colony to be founded if and/or when we are able to clear the colony to the north of danger. We somewhat reluctantly agree, and head north.

With details of the monster being large, violent, carnivorous, and having three heads– we see signs of scales, scorched stone, and drag marks. We follow them to a cave, and overhear the sounds of bestial snoring. We creep further into the cave, led by Cedrick with Dane making too much noise behind him, but don’t seem to wake the monster…
