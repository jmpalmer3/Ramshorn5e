[[Garrin Branchfall]] is on watch, everyone in the camp is missing. There is a shadowy figure who runs away from him. He catches up and finds his dad who asks why he left him with 'her'. 
[[Cedrick Ballard]] is on watch, someone sprints in the darkness, he sees it is [[Eleanor Ballard]]. He catches up and she says she needs help, her eyes are black, and then dematerializes. 

Cedrick and Garrin talk about their night and then tell the group about it. Garrin is in denial about his father talking about his mother. 

Cedrick hears Weaver telling him to build the focus 

Cedrick on the next watch sees a wolf like beast. Garrin sees the same thing.

We run into a band of harpies and bring some food to make peace. We ask them about primal magic and get some answers. 

![[session-50-4.png|600]]  ![[worshiper-of-kratiris.png|300]]

We run into a worshiper of Kratiris. He is suspicious and Garrin can't tell if he worships the same god as him. They eventually go on the chase and knock him out, finding a map of the heavenly step, not the actual location. We decide to take him with us to [[Ramshorn]] to figure out more about him.

We continue to travel, leaving a water buffalo to live.

As they arrive [[The Elder]] comes out and tells Cedrick his family was there. [[Eleanor Ballard]] is unconscious and not doing well. Lucas and Ellie are there. Ellie runs off in anger, while Lucas stays and talks. They have catch up and embrace. Garrin helps try to decipher what is wrong with her. She can't seem to fully understand, but does heal her in hopes to help improve her health. 

They got called through to a room when leaving [[Agrevar]], but then had to temporarily go back, but is unsure why. Then when they got there, [[Eleanor Ballard]] was in this condition.
