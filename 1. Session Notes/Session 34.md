## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 34]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

We continue on to the [[Mirage Oasis]], on the way we found some salesman looking for people  who are virgins and were born on the 66th day of the year. Seller's name was [[Cusetho]]. 

[[Zion Dawnbreak|Zion]] turns into an 18 year old and tries to tell the people that he was a virgin born on the 66th day of the year. Tells him that he needs to head to the capital to meet with [[Ayre]] for experimentation based on a rare phenotype only he would have. 

Suddenly on the road, the group we were talking with gets ambushed and we join in to defend them. Unfortunately, they died and the rest of the enemies were killed even though we tried to keep one alive. Unfortunately, we got stuck in Sol's plant growth. 

Going to the old [[Mirage Oasis]] place, we found the under ground base had been caved in. There was fresh blood that we followed to a temple.
