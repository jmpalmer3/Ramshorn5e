We throw open the doors to the lab, and are met by a cultist, the alchemist, and a brain in a jar. The two are standing around a corpse on an operating table with her skull opened up. The cultist tells us we should not be there and not to interrupt the woman’s “ascension to the choir”. We ignore them after seeing the corpse, and they are quickly dispatched by [[Cedrick]] and [[Sol]]. The brain comes to life, seizing mental control of [[Cedrick]], and calls out to [[Dane]] in recognition. She is an abducted citizen of [[Ramshorn]] , and quickly reveals that she has been somewhat brainwashed into believing in this “choir”. The party decides on a mercy killing– due in part to how dangerous its psionic abilities seem– and we do so. 

We proceed deeper into the facility, and come across a massive gemlike stone thrumming with energy and letting off a soothing magical aura. [[Cedrick]]  goes off on his own to check the other end, and we are accosted by more undead which are quickly dealt with. 

We then reconvene back at the magic stone, which [[Dane]]  discovers makes a different sound as it tilts– and so naturally plays a “jaunty little tune” by tilting it around, and does a very good job at that. This device has no connection to known technology, but [[Sol]]  is able to tell by the structure that it is likely a naturally occurring object and not something manufactured. With the party’s consent, [[Dane]]  decides to “fuck around and find out” and flips the object upside down, which immediately crescendos in tone before dropping out of the sky and the soothing aura disappeared. Flipping it back upright seems to have no effect, and [[Dane]]  seems to have effectively “broke it”.

We decided to leave it for now and continue clearing out the area. While [[Cedrick]]  scouts ahead, he overhears through the door to one of the rooms an ominous voice preaching to a group. The sermon goes as such:

>“Welcome to the sacred gathering where the echoes of existence weave together in harmonious threads. Today, we embark on a journey to join the celestial choir, where every note resonates with the pulse of the cosmos.
>
>Embrace the melody of the ages, for within the cadence of time lies the key to unlocking the secrets of the Great Beyond. Each of you is a note in the grand symphony of the universe, and together, we shall create a masterpiece that transcends mortal comprehension.
>
>Let the song of ages guide you, as you become one with the cosmic vibrations. Shed the shackles of the mundane and elevate your essence to resonate with the divine frequencies. In the harmony of unity, we find the true essence of existence, and in the choir, we discover the power to shape reality itself.
>
>Join hands, fellow travelers, and let the music of the cosmos flow through your very being. As you sing the song of ages, remember that you are not merely a spectator but an integral part of the cosmic performance. We shall transcend the boundaries of the mundane and ascend to the sublime realms of the Great Beyond.”

By random impulsive decision, [[Zion]]  decides to just throw open another door and is immediately noticed and invited into the room where an unsettling robed creature with a similar voice to the preacher sits in a chair overlooking a fight pit where a large nosferatu-lookin ass thing is fighting an undead swordsman. We are asked if we are there for the sermon by the robed figure, and after claiming we have somewhere to be, he dismisses us with a sense of boredom. We leave them to their activities, and continuing onwards we come across a bathroom with what seems to be sigils of noble houses and find a stone box. [[Dane]]  cracks it open with a shovel, and is met by a rotting, stinking mess of a corpse that has been compacted down into the box as a meat cube with his head sitting neatly on top– which begins to speak to us and fill us in on some basic information.

We learn that this new world is called [[Minastria]], and that this is the site of some kind of cult that believes in “the choir”. A promised cosmic power that has the ability to shape reality. [[Cedrick]] gets frustrated with the head’s needlessly convoluted answers to simple questions, and decides he doesn’t like the head. [[Dane]] warms up to the head due to how friendly and informative he is, and names him Fred– a friendly name that nobody could hate. After a few more brief questions, [[Dane]] learns that these people are [[Human]]– or at least their language’s equivalent to [[Human|Humans]]– and that [[Elf|Elves]] also exist so there are similarities in races on this alien planet.

After arriving to the southernmost area, [[Zion]] breaks off from the party and joins in on the sermon while [[Dane]], [[Cedrick]], and [[Sol]] enter a different room with another brain in a container, but this time the container lies broken on the ground and the brain begging for help. 

After some minor interrogation, the group elects to patch up the brain on the pretense that if it betrays them they could easily destroy it. [[Zion]] learns more about this [[Cult of the Choir]] through the sermon, and a “seed” is planted in his head that makes it all start to make sense. Shortly after, [[Zion]] rejoins the group and makes some suspicious remarks about the cult not being all bad that puts [[Cedrick]] on edge. We barricade the door and set about our rest as the brain expires in the tank.
