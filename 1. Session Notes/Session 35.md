## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 34#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]

We join the gang, after [[Cedrick Ballard|Cedrick]] got thrown in the lake by [[Dane Ogden|Dane]] and [[Garrin Branchfall|Garrin]] got punched by [[Dane Ogden|Dane]]. [[Cedrick Ballard|Cedrick]] is not happy, but is starting to lose steam in his fight against [[Dane Ogden|Dane]]. The squad wanted to go to the house in the distance, but wanted to scope it out first. [[Sol Siofra|Sol]] talks to a tree who is wholly unhelpful, then talks to a mushroom and an [[elk]]. 

We decide that [[Zion Dawnbreak|Zion]] should go in disguise and knock on the door. He knocks and they talk about needing an estate seal to get in. After many back and forths, we learn they are with [[The Free Mage Marauders]] and that [[Graydon Abraham|The Admiral]]'s (leader of the group) son was taken by the [[Cult of the Choir]].

[[Garrin Branchfall|Garrin]] went to prove who he is to the group, he is introduced to [[Mary Abraham]], who is the daughter of [[Graydon Abraham|The Admiral]]. She takes her blood and proves who he is. They are taken inside and have a discussion with those inside on the disappearances that seem to potentially stem from the [[Cult of the Choir]]. We are introduced to [[Graydon Abraham|The Admiral]], and introduced to his real name of [[Graydon Abraham]]. 

[[Cedrick Ballard|Cedrick]] builds a fort, but [[Garrin Branchfall|Garrin]] has to show up and one up him. 

[[Zion Dawnbreak|Zion]] and [[Cindril Odd|Cindril]] stay within [[the estate]]. [[Zion Dawnbreak|Zion]] meets with a reclaimer, pretending to be Ta, and tries to get information from them. Ta's sister is named Sulah. [[Cindril Odd|Cindril]] talks with a [[Hag]] trying to get any insight on what caused his memory loss when he was 15. 

We end up on a beach near where we once found the original reclaimers outpost. The outpost is no longer there but we found [[Havra the Scholar]] who is teaching a yoga class. She teleported here with her class from [[Frufast]], but doesn't have room for us. She does say that they likely use illusionary magic on us to make us think we were here before. 

We then head south and find a [[dwarf]] who is about to be chained and enslaved. After intimidating them to leave him alone. He seems to be incredibly depressed and cursed. Seeming to be able to connect with the parties dads. Except [[Cedrick Ballard|Cedrick]], he just calls him a bitch.
