## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 26]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


Cedrick awakens, half naked and chained to a chair, face-to-face with a masked man. After a few questions, the man removes his mask to reveal himself as Cedrick– albeit older and more grizzled. He tells Cedrick “I was here first” before being interrupted by a man referring to him as “sir” and leaving the room. 

Once he’s alone, Cedrick uses a personally smuggled pick to free himself. Shortly after, the man re-enters the room and claims to have verified that Cedrick is in-fact real. Cedrick tells the story of how we came to this new planet and starts to spiral into manic confusion, while the older Cedrick seems to maintain his composure and inquires about Cedrick’s “other world”. After a bit of back and forth, the man leaves Cedrick a vial with instructions to breathe it in when he’s ready to return. He does so, passes out, reawakens in the bottom of the chasm he left, and follows the trail of Dane and Zion.

Back in the capital, Dane and Zion enter the palace and are met by Captain Ked and an older man on a palanquin named Ayre who gives us his condolences for our loss and confirms that the emperor could help us. Ked tells us the emperor has been briefed and awaits us, so we go to meet him.

We enter the emperor’s chamber to witness him. The emperor appears to be a man of massive stature, radiating light and energy, on a massive regal throne surrounded by highly decorated knights. The emperor welcomes us, and promises to bring Sol back in exchange for us locating and retrieving three Lunar Shards for him– and to extend an imperial aqueduct to Ramshorn as a show of good faith. The overall terms are overwhelmingly amicable, and both Dane and Zion readily agree to the emperor’s terms before taking our leave.

Dane follows Zion’s advice to find Ayre and inquire about finding the Lunar shards. We enter another doorway in the palace, and meet Imperial Head of Research, Ayre Resys, in his massive alchemical chamber. He sends us to find a woman named <> in the marshy wetlands near Ramshorn.
