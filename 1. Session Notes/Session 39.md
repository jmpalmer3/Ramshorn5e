## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 38#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


Crew starts by the cart in the center of [[Frufast]] 

They start to discuss what to do with Zion running off. 

Cedrick wants to wait 48 hours while Dane wants to leave soon, but agrees to 48 hours if he can punch Zion in the face and break his jaw if the reason is dumb. They discuss for a long time with a talking stick and set on trying to find him today and heading out tomorrow with potentially Cedrick staying behind. 

A voice comes to Cedrick, it says he can help him get the recognition he deserves and help him reconnect with her, assuming to be his wife. The voice says to go to the Sanctuary where they can discuss easier due to the crux of lay lines.

We found a sage tied to the Archanist Tower in the tower and they gave us a diviner to scrying. He found Zion in the capital in , so the crew decides to head out. 
On the road we are attacked by two [[bulette]]'s 

We then find a camp of [[Arcanist Accord]] people and a man named [[Hotu]] trying to get into a labyrinth. They have been sending people in, but they have all been going in and betraying each other and killing each other, they then sent in one guy and haven't heard from him. Then [[The Free Mage Marauders]] then showed up and set up closer and sent a champion in who they haven't heard from. 

Suddenly attacked by [[harpy]]'s, but Dane uses [[counterspell]] with his wand of counterspell. Due to the Harpy's and the Marauders living on the islands, they are in alliance. They are the only nation to be able to traverse the seas. 

So we go talk with the Marauders and meet [[Thorn Maxim]]. Does not like that we are on good terms with [[Arcanist Accord]]. That being said, as we are talking, some [[specter]]'s take control of some of their crew and a fight ensues.
