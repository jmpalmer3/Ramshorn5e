We wake up from the recent crash, hundreds of feet into the chasm before. We are bloodied, and the bus destroyed beyond salvage or repair– so we retrieve our valuables from the bus and elect to head north in hopes of finding a way up to the fortress.

We are met with a dead end, and so retrace our steps back to the bus wreckage to camp for the night where hijinks and shenanigans are had.

The following morning after setting out, we come across a fork in the road– southeast towards ruins, or southwest towards some stacked stones in the distance. Dane and Sol insist that the ruins are a sign of civilization and likely contains an exit to the surface, while the rest of the group elects to go southwest towards the cairns. After some pushback, Dane and Sol relent and follow the rest to a site where there are skulls and pillars. Ignoring common sense again, the group elects to fuck around and find out, and place the fallen skulls onto the pillars where they are rewarded with their travel fatigue magically removed by a thankful ghost.

Continuing on after a coin toss with Cayden’s supposed blessing decides our path, we come across a chasm with a strange river, where Cedrick’s intrusive thoughts take over and he tosses a stone into the river– aggravating a horrifying creature who attacks the group immediately. A horrible combat ensues, and the creature eventually succumbs to a barrage of fireballs and scorching rays while Cedrick drowns in the strange river that saps his life away.

Before he dies for good, Dane lasso’s his body out of the river and he is revitalized by Sol and Zion. We take a short rest, and set off along the path ahead where we caught sight of a [[Duergar]] mining group in the distance. Dane insists that we throw caution aside and approach the “blue collar” workers as friends.
