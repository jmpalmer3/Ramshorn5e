## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 40#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


We beat Dane's possessed ass, the spirit comes out and we kill it. 

We rest and Cedrick sees someone down the hallway. We go down the hall and the walls close behind us. 

We run into a door with a high door knob and massive keyhole that is locked. The group sends Cedrick up to deal with the keyhole. He asks cindril for help with how big the keyhole is. They work together to flawlessly open the lock, but notice a tripwire. Cedrick investigates and tries to deal with it. There are two wires, he isn't sure which to cut, so he picks one and it is hot, before he cuts he hesitates before continuing on. It cuts, hears some small sounds, but nothing happens. We are then left with the one trick wire which seems to be electric. 

Sol and Dane head through the door, Dane athletically, and Sol as a Dur. They go through and see a tesla coil tied to the wire. After some investigation they cut the wire and we head through the trapless door. 

We run into the Temple of Inera/Nasara. 
We found the marauder that went into the temple, [[Tandy Granger]], and some of her crew. Also one of the possessors that we fought earlier showed up. Finally some other undead show up.

We kill them and then talk down the maurauders to not kill us and take the tome. 


The room then freezes and Cedrick meets [[Weaver]], was a powerful mage who got stuck in the lay lines when coming from another plane of existence, he was part of the ethereals. He wants to help Cedrick bring his family back and set up a place for them to talk and connect in Ramshorn. Claims to just want to have influence again. Cedrick accepts and says he will talk further with the party about it.
