## Recap of Last Session

![[Session 42#Session Summary]]

## Session Summary

![[Current To Do List]]


The crew ends up at a waterfall looking for Dane and Garrin's dads. We find a vat or random red gelatin. Sol decides to chat with plants to see if they had seen Garrin's dad. 

The plant reveals some sylvan text that says "Enter and give up what you cannot live without"

Garrin reinvestigates the blood and finds that it is blood. 

We go into the pool of water, find nothing
we go again, but without any breathe, and we get pulled in by a hand

We all turn into different colors, I'm gold
